How to use node.js as a web development platform?

Node.js is fantastic when it comes to running JS on the server side but with powerful tools like npm, its module system or browserify it can also become a powerful development platform to write and build applications.

## Writing web applications, what is required?

- Module management for dependencies, either own dependencies or third-party dependencies
- Running tests, whether they are unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, you name it
- Build your application, when you're ready to execute it
- Package your application, when you want to deliver it.
